@article{Xu2012,
abstract = {We derive generalization bounds for learning algorithms based on their robustness: the property that if a testing sample is “similar” to a training sample, then the testing error is close to the training error. This provides a novel approach, different from complexity or stability arguments, to study generalization of learning algorithms. One advantage of the robustness approach, compared to previous methods, is the geometric intuition it conveys. Consequently, robustness-based analysis is easy to extend to learning in non-standard setups such as Markovian samples or quantile loss. We further show that a weak notion of robustness is both sufficient and necessary for generalizability, which implies that robustness is a fundamental property that is required for learning algorithms to work.},

@inproceedings{Bertolino2007,
abstract = {Software engineering comprehends several disciplines devoted to prevent and remedy malfunctions and to warrant adequate behaviour. Testing, the subject of this paper, is a widespread validation approach in industry, but it is still largely ad hoc, expensive, and unpredictably effective. Indeed, software testing is a broad term encompassing a variety of activities along the development cycle and beyond, aimed at different goals. Hence, software testing research faces a collection of challenges. A consistent roadmap of the most relevant challenges to be addressed is here proposed. In it, the starting point is constituted by some important past achievements, while the destination consists of four identified goals to which research ultimately tends, but which remain as unreachable as dreams. The routes from the achievements to the dreams are paved by the outstanding research challenges, which are discussed in the paper along with interesting ongoing work.},
