@article{Chen1998,
abstract = {In software testing, a set of test cases is constructed according to some predeened selection criteria. The software is then examined against these test cases. Three interesting observations have been made on the current artifacts of software testing. Firstly, an error-revealing test case is considered useful while a successful test case which does not reveal software errors is usually not further investigated. Whether these successful test cases still contain useful information for revealing software errors has not been properly studied. Secondly, no matter how extensive the testing has been conducted in the development phase, errors may still exist in the software 5. These errors, if left undetected, may eventually cause damage to the production system. The study of techniques for uncovering software errors in the production phase is seldom addressed in the literature. Thirdly, as indicated by Weyuker in 66, the availability of test oracles is pragmatically unattainable in most situations. However, the availability of test oracles is generally assumed in conventional software testing techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel test case selection technique that derives new test cases from the successful ones. The selection aims at revealing software errors that are possibly left undetected in successful test cases which may be generated using some existing strategies. As such, the proposed technique augments the eeectiveness of existing test selection strategies. The},

@article{Zhou2004,
abstract = {An " oracle " in software testing is a procedure by which testers can decide whether the output of the program under test-ing is correct. In some situations, however, the oracle is not available or too difficult to apply. This is known as the " or-acle problem " . In other situations, the oracle is often the human tester who checks the testing result manually. The manual prediction and verification of program output greatly decreases the efficiency and increases the cost of testing. A metamorphic testing method has been proposed to test pro-grams without the involvement of an oracle. It employs prop-erties of the target function, known as metamorphic relations, to generate follow-up test cases and verify the outputs},

@inproceedings{Bertolino2007,
abstract = {Software engineering comprehends several disciplines devoted to prevent and remedy malfunctions and to warrant adequate behaviour. Testing, the subject of this paper, is a widespread validation approach in industry, but it is still largely ad hoc, expensive, and unpredictably effective. Indeed, software testing is a broad term encompassing a variety of activities along the development cycle and beyond, aimed at different goals. Hence, software testing research faces a collection of challenges. A consistent roadmap of the most relevant challenges to be addressed is here proposed. In it, the starting point is constituted by some important past achievements, while the destination consists of four identified goals to which research ultimately tends, but which remain as unreachable as dreams. The routes from the achievements to the dreams are paved by the outstanding research challenges, which are discussed in the paper along with interesting ongoing work.},
